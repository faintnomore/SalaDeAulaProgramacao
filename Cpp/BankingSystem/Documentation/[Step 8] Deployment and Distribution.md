### Step 8: Deployment and Distribution

Now that the banking system project is complete and documented, the next step is to deploy and distribute it. This involves setting up the environment where the system will run, making it accessible to users, and ensuring it runs smoothly in a production setting.

#### 8.1 Setting Up the Deployment Environment

**1. Choose the Deployment Platform:**
   - Decide whether the system will be deployed on a local server, a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), or a combination of both.

**2. Install Necessary Software:**
   - Ensure the deployment environment has all the necessary software installed, including the C++ runtime, MySQL server, and any libraries used in your project.

**Example: Setting Up a Linux Server**
```sh
# Update the package list
sudo apt update

# Install MySQL server
sudo apt install mysql-server

# Secure the MySQL installation
sudo mysql_secure_installation

# Install CMake and other necessary tools
sudo apt install cmake g++ libmysqlcppconn-dev
```

#### 8.2 Configuring the Database

**1. Export the Database Schema:**
   - Export the database schema and any initial data from your development environment.

**Example: Exporting Database Schema**
```sh
mysqldump -u root -p --databases banking_system > banking_system.sql
```

**2. Import the Database Schema:**
   - Import the exported schema into the production database.

**Example: Importing Database Schema**
```sh
mysql -u root -p < banking_system.sql
```

#### 8.3 Building the Project for Production

**1. Compile the Project:**
   - Compile the project on the deployment server.

**Example: Compiling the Project**
```sh
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/project

# Create a build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Run CMake to generate the build files
cmake ..

# Compile the project
make
```

**2. Set Up Environment Variables:**
   - Configure any necessary environment variables, such as database connection strings.

**Example: Setting Environment Variables**
```sh
export DB_HOST="127.0.0.1"
export DB_USER="root"
export DB_PASSWORD="your_password"
export DB_NAME="banking_system"
```

#### 8.4 Running the Project

**1. Start the Application:**
   - Run the compiled executable.

**Example: Running the Application**
```sh
./BankingSystem
```

**2. Monitor Logs:**
   - Monitor the application logs to ensure it is running smoothly and to catch any errors early.

**Example: Viewing Logs**
```sh
tail -f /path/to/logfile.log
```

#### 8.5 Setting Up Remote Access (Optional)

If the banking system needs to be accessed remotely, you might need to set up a web server or configure remote access.

**Example: Setting Up a Web Server with Apache**
```sh
# Install Apache
sudo apt install apache2

# Configure the web server to serve your application
# This involves setting up Virtual Hosts, security settings, etc.
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
```

**Example: Enabling Remote MySQL Access**
```sh
# Edit MySQL configuration to allow remote connections
sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

# Comment out or adjust the bind-address line
# bind-address = 127.0.0.1

# Restart MySQL server
sudo systemctl restart mysql

# Grant remote access to the database user
mysql -u root -p
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON banking_system.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### 8.6 Distribution

**1. Create a Distribution Package:**
   - Package your application, including the executable, configuration files, and necessary scripts.

**Example: Creating a Tarball**
```sh
tar -cvzf BankingSystem.tar.gz BankingSystem config scripts
```

**2. Distribute the Package:**
   - Share the package via a distribution platform, such as a company server, GitHub Releases, or an internal network.

**Example: Uploading to GitHub Releases**
```sh
# Assuming you have a GitHub repository set up
# Create a new release and upload the package
```

#### 8.7 Ensuring Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

Implementing CI/CD ensures that any new changes are automatically tested and deployed. Use tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD.

**Example: GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow**
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up MySQL
      uses: mirromutth/mysql-action@v1
      with:
        mysql version: '5.7'
        database: 'banking_system'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: sudo apt-get install -y cmake g++ libmysqlcppconn-dev

    - name: Build the project
      run: |
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        cd build
        ./run_tests

    - name: Deploy
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      run: ./deploy.sh
```

By following these steps, you will successfully deploy and distribute your banking system project, making it available for users and ensuring it operates reliably in a production environment.
