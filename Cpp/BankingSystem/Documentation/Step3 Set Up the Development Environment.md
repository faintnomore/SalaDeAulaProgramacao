### Step 3: Set Up the Development Environment

In this step, we'll set up the necessary tools and environment to start developing the banking system project in C++. Here’s a detailed guide:

#### 3.1 Install MySQL

1. **Download MySQL:**
   - Go to the [MySQL download page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
   - Download the MySQL installer for your operating system.

2. **Install MySQL:**
   - Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
   - Configure MySQL server settings, such as setting the root password.

3. **Start MySQL Server:**
   - Ensure the MySQL server is running. You can usually do this from the MySQL Workbench or command line:
     ```sh
     sudo systemctl start mysql  # On Linux
     ```

#### 3.2 Set Up the Database

1. **Open MySQL Workbench:**
   - If you installed MySQL Workbench, open it to manage your database.
   
2. **Create the Database and Tables:**
   - Create a new database named `banking_system`.
   - Execute the following SQL scripts to create the necessary tables:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE banking_system;
   USE banking_system;

   CREATE TABLE Customers (
       customer_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       address VARCHAR(255),
       contact_info VARCHAR(255)
   );

   CREATE TABLE Accounts (
       account_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       customer_id INT,
       account_type VARCHAR(255),
       balance DOUBLE,
       FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
   );

   CREATE TABLE Transactions (
       transaction_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       transaction_type VARCHAR(255),
       amount DOUBLE,
       date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       source_account INT,
       destination_account INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (source_account) REFERENCES Accounts(account_id),
       FOREIGN KEY (destination_account) REFERENCES Accounts(account_id)
   );
   ```

#### 3.3 Install MySQL Connector for C++

1. **Download MySQL Connector/C++:**
   - Go to the [MySQL Connector/C++ download page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/).
   - Download the appropriate version for your system.

2. **Install MySQL Connector/C++:**
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the download page.
   - Ensure that the library files are correctly placed in your system’s library path.

3. **Include MySQL Connector in Your Project:**
   - When compiling your project, link against the MySQL Connector/C++ library.

#### 3.4 Set Up Your C++ Development Environment

1. **Choose an IDE or Text Editor:**
   - Some popular options include Visual Studio, CLion, Code::Blocks, or even a text editor like VSCode.

2. **Install a C++ Compiler:**
   - Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. Common options are GCC (for Linux) or MSVC (for Windows).

3. **Create a Project Directory:**
   - Create a directory for your banking system project.

4. **Set Up a Build System (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Use a build system like CMake to manage your project. Here’s an example `CMakeLists.txt`:

   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
   project(BankingSystem)

   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)

   # Include MySQL Connector/C++ headers
   include_directories(/path/to/mysql/connector/include)

   # Link against MySQL Connector/C++ library
   link_directories(/path/to/mysql/connector/lib)

   add_executable(BankingSystem main.cpp Customer.cpp Account.cpp Transaction.cpp BankingServices.cpp)

   target_link_libraries(BankingSystem mysqlcppconn)
   ```

5. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Ensure you have all required libraries installed and properly linked.

#### 3.5 Example Main File and Database Connection

Create a `main.cpp` file as the entry point for your application. Set up a simple database connection test.

```cpp
#include <mysql_driver.h>
#include <mysql_connection.h>
#include <cppconn/statement.h>
#include <cppconn/resultset.h>
#include <iostream>

sql::mysql::MySQL_Driver *driver;
sql::Connection *con;

void connectToDatabase() {
    driver = sql::mysql::get_mysql_driver_instance();
    con = driver->connect("tcp://127.0.0.1:3306", "root", "your_password");
    con->setSchema("banking_system");
}

int main() {
    try {
        connectToDatabase();
        std::cout << "Successfully connected to the database!" << std::endl;
        delete con;
    } catch (sql::SQLException &e) {
        std::cerr << "Error connecting to the database: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

#### 3.6 Compile and Run the Project

1. **Compile the Project:**
   - If using CMake, navigate to your project directory and run:
     ```sh
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     ```

2. **Run the Executable:**
   - After successful compilation, run the resulting executable:
     ```sh
     ./BankingSystem
     ```

By following these steps, you'll have a fully set up development environment for your C++ banking system project. Now you can proceed to implement the various features and classes defined in your design.
