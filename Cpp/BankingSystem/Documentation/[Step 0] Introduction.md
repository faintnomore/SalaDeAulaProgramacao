That sounds like a great project to reinforce your C++ skills and learn about object-oriented programming (OOP) as well as integrating with a database using MySQL. Here’s a structured approach to developing your banking system project:

### Step 1: Define the Requirements
**Functional Requirements:**
1. **Customer Management:** Add, update, and delete customer records.
2. **Account Management:** Create, update, and delete accounts.
3. **Transactions:** Perform withdrawals, deposits, and transfers.
4. **View Information:** Display account details, balances, and transaction history.

**Non-functional Requirements:**
1. **Security:** Ensure secure access to customer and account information.
2. **Performance:** Optimize for quick transactions and queries.
3. **Usability:** Simple and intuitive user interface.

### Step 2: Design the System

#### 2.1 Class Diagram
- **Customer:** Customer details (name, address, contact information, etc.)
- **Account:** Account details (account number, type, balance, customer ID)
- **Transaction:** Transaction details (transaction ID, type, amount, date, source account, destination account)
- **BankingServices:** Methods for withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and viewing information

#### 2.2 Database Schema
- **Customers Table:** `customer_id`, `name`, `address`, `contact_info`
- **Accounts Table:** `account_id`, `customer_id`, `account_type`, `balance`
- **Transactions Table:** `transaction_id`, `transaction_type`, `amount`, `date`, `source_account`, `destination_account`

### Step 3: Set Up the Development Environment
1. **Install MySQL:** Ensure MySQL is installed and running.
2. **Set Up Database:** Create the necessary tables and relationships.
3. **Install MySQL Connector:** Install the MySQL Connector for C++.

### Step 4: Implement the Classes
1. **Customer Class:**
   ```cpp
   class Customer {
   private:
       int customer_id;
       std::string name;
       std::string address;
       std::string contact_info;
   public:
       // Constructors, getters, and setters
   };
   ```

2. **Account Class:**
   ```cpp
   class Account {
   private:
       int account_id;
       int customer_id;
       std::string account_type;
       double balance;
   public:
       // Constructors, getters, and setters
   };
   ```

3. **Transaction Class:**
   ```cpp
   class Transaction {
   private:
       int transaction_id;
       std::string transaction_type;
       double amount;
       std::string date;
       int source_account;
       int destination_account;
   public:
       // Constructors, getters, and setters
   };
   ```

4. **BankingServices Class:**
   ```cpp
   class BankingServices {
   public:
       // Methods for withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and viewing information
       void deposit(int account_id, double amount);
       void withdraw(int account_id, double amount);
       void transfer(int source_account_id, int destination_account_id, double amount);
       void viewAccountDetails(int account_id);
       void viewTransactionHistory(int account_id);
   };
   ```

### Step 5: Connect to MySQL Database
Use the MySQL Connector to connect your C++ application to the MySQL database.

```cpp
#include <mysql_driver.h>
#include <mysql_connection.h>
#include <cppconn/statement.h>
#include <cppconn/resultset.h>

sql::mysql::MySQL_Driver *driver;
sql::Connection *con;

void connectToDatabase() {
    driver = sql::mysql::get_mysql_driver_instance();
    con = driver->connect("tcp://127.0.0.1:3306", "username", "password");
    con->setSchema("banking_system");
}
```

### Step 6: Implement the Banking Services Methods
Implement methods for deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and viewing information using SQL queries to interact with the database.

### Step 7: Testing and Debugging
Thoroughly test each feature of your banking system to ensure correctness and reliability. Use unit tests where applicable and debug any issues that arise.

### Step 8: User Interface
Design a simple command-line interface to interact with the system. Alternatively, you could create a graphical user interface using a library like Qt if you're comfortable with it.

### Step 9: Documentation
Document your code and provide a user manual to help others understand how to use your system.

### Step 10: Deployment
Deploy your application, ensuring it’s secure and efficient.

Here's an example of how you might implement the deposit function in the `BankingServices` class:

```cpp
void BankingServices::deposit(int account_id, double amount) {
    connectToDatabase();
    sql::PreparedStatement *pstmt;
    pstmt = con->prepareStatement("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ? WHERE account_id = ?");
    pstmt->setDouble(1, amount);
    pstmt->setInt(2, account_id);
    pstmt->executeUpdate();
    delete pstmt;
    delete con;
}
```

This should give you a solid foundation to start your banking system project. Good luck!
