### Step 7: Documentation and Maintenance

Proper documentation and maintenance are crucial for the long-term success and usability of your project. This step involves creating comprehensive documentation and setting up a maintenance plan.

#### 7.1 Creating Documentation

**1. Code Comments:**
   - Ensure that your code is well-commented to explain the purpose of each function and class. This will help other developers (and your future self) understand the code quickly.

**Example: Commenting Functions and Classes**
```cpp
// Customer.h
class Customer {
public:
    // Constructor to initialize a new customer
    Customer(int id, std::string name, std::string address, std::string contact);
    
    // Method to add a customer to the database
    void addCustomer();

    // Method to update customer details in the database
    void updateCustomer();

    // Method to delete a customer from the database
    void deleteCustomer();
    
    // Setters and Getters
    void setCustomerID(int id);
    int getCustomerID() const;

private:
    int customerID;
    std::string name;
    std::string address;
    std::string contact;
};
```

**2. README File:**
   - Create a README file in your projectâ€™s root directory. This file should provide an overview of the project, instructions for setting up the development environment, and usage guidelines.

**Example: README.md**
```markdown
# Banking System

## Overview
This project is a simple banking system implemented in C++ with an object-oriented approach. It allows for the management of customers, accounts, and transactions, as well as performing basic banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

## Features
- Add, update, and delete customers
- Create, update, and delete accounts
- Deposit and withdraw funds
- Transfer funds between accounts
- View account details and transaction history

## Technologies
- C++ programming language
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- MySQL for database management

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- MySQL server
- MySQL Connector/C++ library
- `spdlog` (for logging)
- (Optional) `ncurses` (for terminal-based UI)

### Database Setup
1. Start MySQL server.
2. Create the database and required tables using the following commands:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE banking_system;

USE banking_system;

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    address VARCHAR(255),
    contact VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Accounts (
    account_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    account_type VARCHAR(255),
    balance DOUBLE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    transaction_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    transaction_type VARCHAR(255),
    amount DOUBLE,
    date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    source_account INT,
    destination_account INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (source_account) REFERENCES Accounts(account_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (destination_account) REFERENCES Accounts(account_id)
);
```

### Compilation and Execution
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the project using CMake or your preferred build system.
   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./BankingSystem
   ```

## Usage
1. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the banking system.
2. Choose the appropriate options to perform various operations.

**3. API Documentation:**
   - If your project includes APIs (even if internal), document each endpoint, the expected input, and the output.

**Example: API Documentation (if applicable)**
```markdown
### API Documentation

#### Add Customer
- **Endpoint:** `/addCustomer`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Input:**
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "address": "123 Main St",
    "contact": "555-1234"
  }
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "customer_id": 1
  }
  ```

#### Create Account
- **Endpoint:** `/createAccount`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Input:**
  ```json
  {
    "customer_id": 1,
    "account_type": "savings",
    "initial_balance": 1000.00
  }
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "account_id": 1
  }
  ```
```

#### 7.2 Maintenance Plan

**1. Version Control:**
   - Use a version control system like Git to track changes and collaborate with others. Make sure to write meaningful commit messages.

**Example: Commit Message**
```
Added functionality to handle insufficient funds during withdrawals and transfers
```

**2. Regular Updates:**
   - Schedule regular updates to review and refactor code, update dependencies, and implement new features.

**3. Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for your code to ensure it works as expected. Use a testing framework like Google Test for C++.

**Example: Simple Unit Test with Google Test**
```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "Account.h"

TEST(AccountTest, CreateAccount) {
    Account account(0, 1, "savings", 1000.00);
    account.createAccount();
    EXPECT_EQ(account.getBalance(), 1000.00);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

**4. Bug Tracking:**
   - Use a bug tracking system to log and manage issues. Tools like GitHub Issues, Jira, or Trello can be useful.

**5. Documentation Updates:**
   - Keep the documentation updated with any changes in the codebase or project structure.

**6. Feedback and Improvement:**
   - Gather feedback from users and other developers to continuously improve the system.

By following these steps, you will ensure that your banking system project is well-documented, maintainable, and robust. This will make it easier for you and others to understand, use, and extend the project in the future.
